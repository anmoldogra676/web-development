1. So our main task is here to learn about promises which is other thing to do work asynchronously 


#Memory Diagram : 
                It is same as async type means there is node api , queue
                ,event loop. so all promises(object) will go to node api 
                and gives the promise of read the file in case of (fs.promises.readFile)
                


Facts :
 Promise :  assurance of work that could be completed in future
 Promise is just like a token and its value depens upon provider
